# imageAsymmetryAnalysis
## Toolkit advanced for ARKS Paper VI (Asymmetries &amp; Offsets). 

The code includes the scripts to reproduce figures C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 from ARKS VI.
These figures are the self-subtraction profiles, for the rotation, mirrored minor axis, and mirrored major axis.

Original code adapted from 'rotate_subtract.py' by G. M. Kennedy, stored here: https://github.com/SebaMarino/ARKS/tree/master/analysis_scripts

non-standard installs needed:
- cmocean, seaborn, pandas, scipy, json, astropy, gofish [for plotting functionality]
